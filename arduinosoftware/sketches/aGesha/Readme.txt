
This program is a fork of Jim Gallt's aBourbon.pde

Initially the main modification is the addition of a new field in the log --
a Variac reading. The reading is taken by one of the TC4's analog input pins.
A low-voltage, unregulated wall-wart or AC transformer is is full-wave
recified and divided down with a simple resistive divider.

In addition, the LCD display has a slightly different layout.
