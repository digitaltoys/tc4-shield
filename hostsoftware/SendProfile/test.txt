/profile.txt
/contains profiles to send to arduino, read from SendProfile.pde Processing program
/lines which start with a "/" are ignored as comment lines
/the start of a profile must start with "@".  
/the program assumes that the 16 char name of the profile follows the @ char
/the format of the profiles must be
/@  (start of profile identifier)
/profile index number  (unique 2 digit number)
/name of profile
/ror
/temp
/time
/offset
/fanspeed
/delta temp
/tbd row 7
/tbd2 row 8
/tbd3 row 9
/max temperature
/profile method  1=time,temp;  2=auto ror, 3=manual ror, 4=deltaT, 5=tbd
/* = end of profile, ^ is end of file to transmit
/
/warnings:  My code is pretty simplistic, so format must be followed.
/Do have have blank lines, and line that is not part of the profile definition should start with a "/"
/do not add comments in a profile definition, the program uses line numbers from the "@" char to format the data to send
